All about farm:

What is farm:
Farm is a computer cluster that runs a distribution of Linux called CentOS version 5.8. 

Setting up your account:
In order to create an account on farm you need to send the CSE Help department your SSH public key. This key is a file created on your computer (not farm) that identifies your computer as your computer to farm. It's like a password that you don't need to type in. The process for generating your SSH public key is as follows:

Mac:
a. Open the terminal (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal)
b. Generate your key:
ssh-keygen -t rsa

c. Accept the default location by pressing Enter.

d. Type in a passphrase.

e. Your system will now generate a key pair:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/myname/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/myname/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
ae:89:72:0b:85:da:5a:f4:7c:1f:c2:43:fd:c6:44:38 myname@mymac.local
The key's randomart image is:

|. + o = o +      |
| o...o * o       |
|.  oo.o .        |
+-----------------+

WARNING: There are two keys generated: private and public. The public key is sent to the farm and the private key stays where it is. NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY. Any computer with your private key can log in to your account. Treat your private key like a password.

f. Your keys are located in the .ssh folder in your home directory:
/Users/[username]/.ssh

g. Your public key is in a file called id_rsa.pub. Attach this file to the email you send to CSE Help.

Windows [someone who knows how to do this in windows should write this section!]:
a. Get a Mac.

b. Follow the steps above.


Farm Defaults:
Farm comes with a lot of software preinstalled. Here's a list of some of the most commonly used ones:
gcc
Git
libsequence
Matlab
Perl
Python
R

Installing programs on farm:
When using farm, you're probably going to need to install some software. Since farm is a Linux computer, it follows much the same procedure as other Linux computers. The main difference is that you can't install things into the default directory. This is because it's located in /bin and you need root access in order to do that. The solution is to change where the binary file is located:

1) Download software:
$ wget http://www.best-software-ever.com/thesis-in-a-box.tar.gz

2) Untar it:
$ tar -xvzf thesis-in-a-box.tar.gz

3) Move to your new directory:
$ cd thesis-in-a-box

4) Configure the program:
$ ./configure --prefix=/home/user/[path for binary executable]/

5) Compile the program:
$ make

6) Move it to the path you specified:
$ make install

Note: this only works for software that is packaged to be installed this way. Always make sure to read the README or INSTALL files to ensure you're doing it right.

Then, to run the program just type in the path:
$ /home/user/programs/thesis

Now, that's a lot to type every time you want to run a program. There are multiple better ways.

1) Alias:
Bash has something called aliases, which let you put your own shorter (usually) command to stand for another command. For example, I could create an alias for my thesis program called "graduate" which runs "/home/user/programs/thesis". I could also create an alias for "ls -a" (show hidden files) called "la". To do this, you need to create a file called ".bash_profile"

a) Make sure you're in the home directory
$ cd

b) Create .bash_profile
$ touch .bash_profile

c) Open it up in your favorite text editor
$ nano .bash_profile

d) Create the aliases by typing this in:
alias graduate="/home/user/programs/thesis"
alias la="ls -a"

e) Save the file:
In nano this is control+O (WriteOut)

f) Reload bash by logging out or with this command:
$ source ~/.bash_profile

2) Add to path:
When you type in a command into bash, bash looks for a binary file matching that command. The places it looks by default on farm are: 
/share/apps/ge-6.2/bin/lx24-amd64
/usr/kerberos/bin
/usr/local/bin
/bin
/usr/bin

We can shorten the command we have to type by adding the binary file to the path. To do this, we add it to the .bash_profile.

a) Make sure you're in the home directory
$ cd

b) Create .bash_profile
$ touch .bash_profile

c) Open it up in your favorite text editor
$ nano .bash_profile

d) Add to your path by typing this in:
PATH=$PATH:/home/user/programs/
export PATH

e) Save the file:
In nano this is control+O (WriteOut)

f) Reload bash by logging out or with this command:
$ source ~/.bash_profile

This will add all binary files in /home/user/programs/ including the one we want, "thesis". To see what is in your path, type this into bash:
$ echo $PATH

To add more folders to your path, just append it to the line with a colon in the beginning:
PATH=$PATH:/home/user/programs/:/home/user/who-needs-organization/bin/
export PATH

Special Farm Things:
Farm has a number of things that make it unique, not dissimilar from a snowflake. These are things you won't see on many Linux distributions and if you try to do it on them, you might get an angry message telling you to do something you're good at (don't listen to it you're beautiful). 

Modules:

This package allows system administrators to update the system libraries and other core programs without breaking your code or scripts. Modules contain the information that the shell needs to locate programs and libraries without getting confused about different versions and different files. For you, this means that before using something like gcc, you need to load it:
$ module load gcc
Module GCC 4.5.0 Loaded.

To see what modules are available, type:
$ module avail

Any one of these modules can be loaded and should be. The special farm thing here is that if you run python, for example, without loading the module, you'll run version 2.4.3. However, if you load the python module, you will get 2.7.3. This becomes an issue when you run python from a script but forget to load the module because you'll be running an old version of python. So remember, if you're using a preinstalled program, make sure you load the module. 

Built-in variables:

When you submit a job on farm, the Sun Grid Engine gives you two variables that change according to some parameters. One is the variable "$SGE_TASK_ID". When running an array of jobs, this variable corresponds to a particular task. Each job in the array has a different value for $SGE_TASK_ID. 

Next, there is "$JOB_ID". This variable changes every time you submit a job. Therefore, when you submit an array of jobs, each job will have the same $JOB_ID, but each one will have a different $SGE_TASK_ID. These variables can be used in conjunction to name output files. For example, you can submit a job like this:

sfs_code 1 1 > out.$JOB_ID.$SGE_TASK_ID

This will save the output in a file named something like this: out.83917.1

Submitting Jobs to farm [copy and paste more stuff from current wiki]:
Speaking of submitting jobs, you are probably going to want to do that. The farm cluster uses the Sun Grid Engine (SGE) to distribute jobs across its 39(?) nodes. When you run simulations, you want them to run on these nodes rather than the one you're logged in to (which is called the head). To submit a job simply type:
$ qsub myjob.sh

The qsub command has a number of options, many of which are necessary: [expand on this from the current wiki] 

-S:
This option tells qsub what shell you're using. You will probably want to use bash:
-S /bin/bash

-cwd:
This tells qsub to run the command from your current working directory. 

-e:
This tells qsub where to put the error log files. If you don't want to save them, put them in /dev/null:
-e /dev/null

-o:
This tells qsub where to put the output log files. If you don't want to save them, or if you are creating your own output files, put them in /dev/null:
-o /dev/null

-t:
This tells qsub that you are submitting an array of jobs. It will run the script you send it multiple times. To specify how many times, use a range. The max number of jobs in an array is 50,000:
-t 1-10

-m: [add this in]

Output to many files vs one:
When using qsub, you are going to want to save the output of each simulation in a different file. This is because when multiple processors write to the same file, bad and funky things happen. James Brown may be pleased, but you will not be. To achieve this, use the built-in variables ($SGE_TASK_ID, $JOB_ID) to number your output files.

Checking up on jobs:
SGE comes with a command called qstat which will tell you the progress of your job:
$ qstat

You can also check the status of a particular job:
$ qstat -j [job-id]

You can delete a job:
$ qdel [job-id]

Log into a compute node:
$ qrsh
