1) I recommend ~/src for compiling source, ~/pkg for installing
  packages, and ~/bin for things you run from the command line.
  So things like:
	cd src; wget http://foo.com/foo.tar.gz
       ./configure --prefix=~/pkg; make make install
       mkdir ~/bin
       ln -sf ~/pkg/foo-1.2.3/bin/foo ~/bin/foo
  Then /runs, /projects, /jobs or similar for job related I/O.
2) Private keys like passwords is good.  But I also suggest they only
  exist where you physically sit.
3) If adding a binary to your path I'd add it first, not last.
  Otherwise you'll likely get the wrong one, so:
    export PATH=~/bin:$PATH not the reverse.
4) Wow, dangerous:
	find -name "[name_of_file].*" | xargs -n131072 rm
  A) that will match directories, god forbid you name the dir
     for the files in it
  B) it won't do at all what you think if there is a space in the
     filename
  C) not sure where 131072 came from, but it's a bad idea, I'd
     suggest the defaults.
  D) you need to name a directory... adding to the danger.

  All in all looks like an excellent way to blow away a directory.

  I'd suggest:
    find . -type f -0 | xargs -0 echo

  That will:
    * work with filenames with spaces in it
    * leave xargs to decide whatever your shell is likely to accept
    * not consider directories
    * echo a harmless list of filenames.
    * user could be advised replace echo with rm if they are sure.
